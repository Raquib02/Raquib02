<h1>Hi, my name is Raqib Chowdhury <br/><a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raqibchowdhury1/">Cybersecurity Professional</a>, </h1>

<h2>About Me:</h2>
<b> Hello, my name is Raqib Chowdhury. I am a first-generation college graduate from Queens, New York, and my family originates from a small country called Bangladesh.
I am very passionate about cybersecurity, especially GRC. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from CUNY Queens College, as well as several professional certificates including CompTIA A+ and Security+.

In my free time, I enjoy learning new things, doing photography, and playing video games as a hobby. To me, every day is a new opportunity to grow, and life should be lived one day and one step at a time.
